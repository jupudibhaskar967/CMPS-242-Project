We have split the work among ourselves and worked as pairs for implementing different parts of the project because there are lot many ideas that we have incorporated.


1) Bhaskar and Trivikram worked on implementing stochastic gradient descent.
2) Chandrahas and  karthikeyan worked on implementing naive bayes for both binary and multiclass versions.
3) Chandrahas and Bhaskar worked on pre-processing of data using multi-processing.
4) Trivikram and karthikeyan worked on implementing cost function and gradient for fmin.
5) All four of us worked on preparing the report by divinding the subsections of the report like figures, tables, equations, text etc., amoung ourselves.
6) All four of us had some brainstorming sessions together on deciding the constriants for pre-processing of the data.


Finally because of team work we were able to achieve all our goals for the project right in time.
