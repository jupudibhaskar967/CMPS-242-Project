\begin{abstract} 
In this project, we aim to perform sentiment analysis i.e., classifying whether the review is postive or negative using the yelp dataset based on reviews and ratings. The classification problem can be solved by a set of algorithms. Every algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy and model complexity. 

For example, Naive Bayes classifier is faster to compute than Logistic Regression classifier for huge datasets. But the disadvantage with the former classifier is that it assumes that features are independent where as the latter has no such assumptions which can lead to better precdiction. Our work mainly concentrates on implementing these two classifiers and techniques to make them perform much better. We have adopted multi-processing for feature extraction to make it way faster and also implemented two different approaches of Logistic regression for both binary and multi-class classfication. We have also implemented Naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we contrast these two algorithms based on time taken for execution and performance metrics like accuracy, precision and recall.
